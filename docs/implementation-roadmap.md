## Long-term Vision

This implementation transforms Lavoisier from a traditional MS analysis tool into a **consciousness-aware molecular intelligence system** that:

- **Proves understanding** rather than accepting pattern matching
- **Processes massive datasets** with unprecedented speed
- **Integrates biological intelligence** for human-like reasoning
- **Eliminates AI hallucination** through embodied validation
- **Sets new standards** for scientific AI systems

The result will be the world's first **truly intelligent molecular analysis system** that demonstrates genuine understanding of molecular structures through video reconstruction capabilities.
