\begin{abstract}
We establish that bounded oscillatory systems partition phase space into discrete categorical states whose enumeration follows geometric constraints independent of the physical substrate. For a system with partition depth $n$, angular complexity bounded by $l < n$, orientation parameter $|m| \leq l$, and binary chirality $s = \pm 1/2$, we prove the capacity formula $C(n) = 2n^2$ and derive the entropy $S = k_B M \ln n$ from first principles. The partition coordinates $(n, l, m, s)$ constitute a complete addressing system for categorical states in any bounded phase space. We demonstrate that hardware oscillators---including mass analyzers, ion traps, and RF circuits---instantiate identical partition geometries, enabling measurement of categorical coordinates through timing analysis. The fragmentation of molecular ions under collision-induced dissociation corresponds to transitions in partition space governed by selection rules $\Delta l = \pm 1$, $\Delta m \in \{-1, 0, +1\}$, $\Delta s = 0$. This framework yields platform-independent molecular characterization: different mass spectrometers measuring identical partition coordinates for the same analyte. We present algorithms for reconstructing molecular structure from partition trajectories and establish metabolite identification as trajectory completion in categorical space.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Consider a bounded region of phase space $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^{2d}$ with finite volume $V = \int_\Omega d^{2d}x$. Any measurement apparatus that interrogates this region must complete at least one oscillation cycle, requiring minimum time $\tau_{\min} = h/\Delta E$ where $\Delta E$ bounds the energy uncertainty. This fundamental constraint---independent of measurement technology---implies that phase space cannot be probed below a resolution determined by oscillator timing.

The central result of this work is that the geometric structure of bounded oscillatory systems determines categorical capacity through constraints that depend only on the topology of the boundary, not on the specific physical realization. We establish the partition coordinate system $(n, l, m, s)$ as the unique complete addressing scheme for categorical states and prove that any hardware oscillator---mechanical, electromagnetic, or quantum---must yield identical coordinate measurements when interrogating the same categorical target.

Mass spectrometry provides the experimental context. A molecular ion confined in an electromagnetic trap occupies a bounded phase space region. Collision-induced dissociation transfers energy across internal modes, inducing transitions between categorical states. These transitions---observable as fragmentation patterns---obey selection rules derivable from partition geometry. The resulting framework enables platform-independent molecular identification: the partition coordinates of glucose measured on a quadrupole instrument must equal those measured on an Orbitrap, though the hardware oscillation frequencies differ by orders of magnitude.

Section~\ref{sec:geometric-partitioning} establishes the mathematical foundations of phase space partitioning in bounded systems. Section~\ref{sec:capacity-theorem} derives the fundamental capacity formula $C(n) = 2n^2$. Section~\ref{sec:entropy-equivalence} proves the equivalence of oscillation, categorization, and partitioning as entropy-generating processes. Section~\ref{sec:oscillatory-theorem} demonstrates that hardware oscillators necessarily implement partition measurements. Section~\ref{sec:hardware-mapping} maps specific mass spectrometry hardware to partition coordinate extraction. Section~\ref{sec:categorical-dynamics} establishes the dynamics of categorical transitions and derives selection rules. Section~\ref{sec:platform-independence} proves platform independence as categorical invariance. Section~\ref{sec:molecular-maxwell-demon} addresses the thermodynamic consistency of partition measurements. Section~\ref{sec:st-stellas-thermodynamics} presents the identification algorithm as trajectory completion in partition space.

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

The partition coordinate framework resolves several longstanding issues in mass spectrometry. The apparent platform dependence of fragmentation patterns---different instruments yielding different spectra for identical compounds---emerges as measurement of different projections of the same underlying partition coordinates. When instruments are characterized by their oscillation hierarchies and the appropriate extraction procedures applied, the resulting coordinates converge.

The capacity formula $C(n) = 2n^2$ provides a theoretical upper bound on structural information extractable from fragmentation at depth $n$. For $n = 4$ (quaternary fragmentation), maximum capacity is $32$ distinct states---consistent with empirical observations that MS$^4$ rarely provides additional structural information beyond MS$^3$ for typical metabolites.

The selection rules $\Delta l = \pm 1$, $\Delta m \in \{-1, 0, +1\}$, $\Delta s = 0$ constrain accessible fragmentation pathways. The chirality conservation rule ($\Delta s = 0$) implies that collision-induced dissociation preserves stereochemistry at non-fragmenting centers---a prediction testable by chiral chromatography of fragment ions.

The identification of measurement with categorical state creation (Section~\ref{sec:molecular-maxwell-demon}) has implications for analytical sensitivity. Each measurement cycle either confirms an existing categorical assignment or establishes a new one, with entropy cost $\Delta S \geq k_B \ln 2$ per bit of information gained. This sets fundamental limits on detection sensitivity independent of hardware improvements.

The trajectory completion algorithm (Section~\ref{sec:st-stellas-thermodynamics}) provides a principled approach to metabolite identification that extends beyond spectral library matching. Unknown compounds with no library entry can still be characterized by their partition coordinates, enabling structure prediction from first principles.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We have established that:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Bounded phase spaces admit partition coordinates $(n, l, m, s)$ with geometric constraints $l < n$, $|m| \leq l$, $s = \pm 1/2$, yielding capacity $C(n) = 2n^2$ at depth $n$.
    
    \item Hardware oscillators necessarily implement partition measurements, with coordinate extraction depending only on timing analysis of oscillation hierarchies.
    
    \item Molecular fragmentation corresponds to categorical transitions governed by selection rules derivable from partition geometry.
    
    \item Platform independence emerges as categorical invariance: different instruments measuring identical partition coordinates for the same analyte.
    
    \item Metabolite identification reduces to trajectory completion in partition space, enabling structure prediction for compounds absent from spectral libraries.
\end{enumerate}

The framework extends to any bounded oscillatory system. Nuclear magnetic resonance, infrared spectroscopy, and chromatographic retention all admit partition coordinate descriptions with the same geometric constraints. The universal character of these results suggests that categorical structure, not continuous dynamics, constitutes the fundamental description of chemical information.
