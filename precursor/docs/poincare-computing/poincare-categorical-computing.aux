Cyan wave: higher frequency, phase $\phi _1$. Purple wave: lower frequency, phase $\phi _2$. Caption: ``No coupling: phases drift independently''. This demonstrates the initial state: uncoupled oscillators have independent phases that drift relative to each other, with phase difference $\Delta \phi = \phi _1 - \phi _2$ increasing linearly with time. \textbf  {(B) Coupling Interaction:} Two circles (cyan and purple) connected by spring (yellow coil). Dashed lines indicate oscillator phases. Caption: ``Interaction enables phase information exchange''. This demonstrates coupling mechanism: when oscillators interact (e.g., via spring, electromagnetic field, or categorical aperture), they exchange phase information. The coupling strength determines how quickly phases synchronize. \textbf  {(C) Phase Synchronization:} Two sinusoidal waves (cyan and purple) with aligned phases. Green horizontal arrow labeled ``Phases converge'' indicates synchronization. Caption: ``Coupling drives phase alignment''. This demonstrates phase-locking: coupling forces phases to align, with phase difference $\Delta \phi \to 0$ as $t \to \infty $. The synchronized state is stable: perturbations decay exponentially. \textbf  {(D) Phase-Locked State:} Two green circles connected by horizontal line labeled ``LOCKED'', overlaid on single green sinusoidal wave. Caption: ``Phase-lock = categorical completion. This connection is now a completed category''. This demonstrates the categorical interpretation: phase-locking IS categorical completion. Two oscillators that phase-lock form a completed category (a stable relationship), and this completion is irreversible (the connection persists). \textbf  {(E) Cascade Effect:} Network diagram shows five nodes (circles) with labels 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Green nodes (0, 1, 3, 4) are highly locked. Cyan nodes (2, 5) are partially locked. Solid green lines indicate strong phase-locks. Dashed orange lines indicate forming locks.

Node 1 locks to node 0, then node 4 locks to node 1, then node 3 locks to node 4, etc. The network grows autocatalytically, with each lock facilitating subsequent locks. \textbf  {(F) Entropy = Network Density:} Scatter plot shows Categorical Entropy $S/S_{\max }$ (vertical, 0 to 1) vs. Network Density (locks/max\_locks, horizontal, 0 to 1).

Labels: ``Sparse: Low $S$'' (bottom left), ``Dense: High $S$'' (top right). Caption: ``More phase-locks = more completed categories = higher entropy''. This demonstrates the entropy-network duality (Theorem~\ref {thm:entropy_network_duality}): categorical entropy $S$ equals network density (fraction of possible phase-locks that have formed). Sparse networks (few locks) have low entropy; dense networks (many locks) have high entropy.

Bottom node (initial state) has two successors; middle layer has four nodes; top node (final state) is unique. The diamond structure demonstrates that multiple completion paths exist from initial to final state, but all paths respect the partial order: if $\gamma _i \prec \gamma _j$, then $\gamma _i$ must be completed before $\gamma _j$. This validates the partial order axiom (Axiom~\ref {axiom:partial_order}). \textbf  {(B) Tri-Dimensional S-Space:} 3D coordinate system shows three orthogonal axes: $S_k$ (knowledge entropy, blue, horizontal), $S_t$ (temporal entropy, green, diagonal), $S_e$ (evolution entropy, red, vertical). Yellow circle marks a point in $\mathcal  {S}= [0,1]^3$. The tri-dimensional structure demonstrates that categorical states are uniquely specified by three coordinates, forming a unit cube in S-entropy space. \textbf  {(C) $3^k$ Branching Structure:} Tree diagram shows recursive tri-branching from root $C$ (top, teal circle) through four levels. Level 1: three children (blue circles). Level 2: nine children ($3^2$, cyan circles). Level 3: 27 children ($3^3$, green circles). Level 4: 81 leaves ($3^4$, red/green/blue circles). Each node branches into three children (corresponding to $S_k$, $S_t$, $S_e$ dimensions), generating exponential growth with base 3. This validates the $3^k$ branching theorem (Theorem~\ref {thm:3k_branching_formal}): depth-$k$ tree contains $3^k$ nodes. \textbf  {(D) Scale Ambiguity: Identical Structure:} Two triangles (Level $n$ and Level $n+1$) with identical topology. Both have three vertices (teal circles) and three edges (blue lines). Red double-headed arrow labeled $\Psi _n$ indicates isomorphism between levels. This demonstrates scale ambiguity: structure at level $n$ is identical to structure at level $n+1$, confirming self-similarity across scales. \textbf  {(E) Completion Trajectory $\gamma (t)$ Expanding:} Plot shows fraction completed $|\gamma (t)|/|c|$ vs. time. Green curve grows from $0$ at $t = 0$ to asymptotic limit $\approx 0.95$ at $t = 10$ (red dashed line marks complete $= 1.0$). Green shaded area shows trajectory envelope. The asymptotic approach confirms that completion is never exact (Theorem~\ref {thm:asymptotic_solution}): trajectory approaches but never reaches $|\gamma (t)|/|c| = 1$. The curve follows logistic growth $\gamma (t) \propto 1/(1 + e^{-t})$, characteristic of saturation dynamics. \textbf  {(F) Asymptotic Slowing $\dot  {C}(t) \to 0$:} Plot shows completion rate $\dot  {C}(t) = d|\gamma (t)|/dt$ vs. time. Red curve decays exponentially from $\dot  {C}(0) \approx 0.3$ to $\dot  {C}(10) \approx 0.01$. Red shaded area shows rate envelope. Black dotted line marks completion time $T$ (when rate drops below threshold). The exponential decay confirms asymptotic slowing (Theorem~\ref {thm:asymptotic_slowing}): completion rate decreases as trajectory approaches final state, requiring infinite time for exact completion.

L1 Cache ($\sim 10^0$ items), L2 Cache ($\sim 10^1$ items), RAM ($\sim 10^3$ items), SSD ($\sim 10^5$ items), Archive ($\sim 10^8$ items). Tier assignment determined by access frequency (Maxwell demon controller, panel F). \textbf {(E) Cache Performance:} Hit rate vs. access count showing asymptotic approach to 100\% target (dashed line). Performance saturates at $\approx 99\%$ after 30--40 accesses as frequently-used states stabilize in fast tiers. The precision-by-difference addressing achieves near-perfect caching without explicit cache management. \textbf {(F) Memory Controller as Maxwell Demon:} Fast tier (blue, left) contains frequently-accessed states (green filled circles); slow tier (red, right) contains rarely-accessed states (white circles). Maxwell demon (orange oval) promotes hot states and demotes cold states based on $\Delta P$ trajectory, implementing thermodynamically-inspired memory management without explicit LRU tracking}{figure.7}{}}

Physical distances vary dramatically: Local ($\approx 0$ km), Jupiter Core ($\approx 10^8$ km), Sun Center ($\approx 10^8$ km), Deep Space ($\approx 10^{14}$ km), Earth Mantle ($\approx 10^3$ km), Moon ($\approx 10^5$ km). Categorical distances are uniformly small ($< 1$ S-unit) and show no correlation with physical distance. The decoupling confirms that categorical space is not embedded in physical space. \textbf  {(C) Equal Measurement Time:} Bar chart shows measurement time (ms) for six locations: Local ($\approx 1.0$ ms), Jupiter Core ($\approx 0.6$ ms), Sun Center ($\approx 0.8$ ms), Deep Space ($\approx 0.4$ ms), Earth Mantle ($\approx 0.4$ ms), Moon ($\approx 0.4$ ms).

Color gradient (purple $\to $ yellow) indicates temporal order. Molecules cluster near $S_k \approx 1.0$ (high knowledge), with broad distribution in $S_t$ and $S_e$ dimensions. The distribution shows non-uniform density, with concentration near $(S_k, S_t, S_e) \approx (1.0, 0.9, 0.5)$, indicating preferred categorical configurations. \textbf  {(B) Polar Phase: $S_t \to \theta $, $S_e \to r$:} Polar plot maps temporal entropy $S_t$ to angle $\theta $ and evolution entropy $S_e$ to radius $r$. Blue line shows trajectory from center ($r = 0$) to $r \approx 1.0$ at $\theta = 0°$ (horizontal right). The trajectory is radial, indicating evolution proceeds outward (increasing $S_e$) at constant phase ($S_t \approx 0$). This demonstrates that evolution and temporal dimensions are orthogonal in polar representation. \textbf  {(C) Ternary Composition:} Ternary diagram shows relative contributions of $S_k$, $S_t$, $S_e$ (three vertices). Colored bar (blue $\to $ red gradient) indicates single molecule trajectory from $S_e$-dominated (bottom vertex) to $S_k$-dominated (top vertex). The trajectory hugs the $S_k$--$S_e$ edge, indicating minimal $S_t$ contribution. This confirms that knowledge and evolution are primary dimensions, with temporal entropy serving as auxiliary coordinate. \textbf  {(D) Density Contour:} Heatmap in $(S_k, S_e)$ plane shows molecular density (color scale: yellow = low density $\approx 0$, red = high density $\approx 35$). Vertical red band at $S_k \approx 1.0$ indicates high-density region where molecules cluster. Density is uniform in $S_e$ dimension ($S_e \in [0, 1]$) but sharply peaked in $S_k$ dimension. This asymmetry reflects the knowledge accumulation property (Theorem~\ref {thm:capability_monotonicity}): molecules evolve toward $S_k = 1$ (complete knowledge) but explore all $S_e$ values. \textbf  {(E) Radial Distribution:} Radial distribution function $g(r)$ vs. distance from center $r = \sqrt  {S_k^2 + S_t^2 + S_e^2}$ shows three peaks: $r \approx 0.72$ ($g(r) \approx 35$, primary peak), $r \approx 0.80$ ($g(r) \approx 10$, secondary peak), $r \approx 0.84$ ($g(r) \approx 8$, tertiary peak). The multi-peak structure indicates shell-like organization, analogous to electron shells in atoms. Molecules preferentially occupy discrete radial distances, suggesting quantization of categorical states. \textbf  {(F) Phase Trajectories:} Scatter plot in $(S_k, S_e)$ plane shows multiple trajectories (colored dots: purple, blue, cyan, yellow, orange, red). Trajectories are vertically aligned ($S_k \approx $ constant), indicating evolution proceeds primarily in $S_e$ dimension at fixed knowledge level. The vertical alignment confirms that knowledge entropy $S_k$ is approximately conserved during trajectory evolution, while evolution entropy $S_e$ fluctuates freely.}}{99}{figure.20}\protected@file@percent }

This asymmetry reflects the knowledge accumulation property (Theorem~\ref {thm:capability_monotonicity}): molecules evolve toward $S_k = 1$ (complete knowledge) but explore all $S_e$ values. \textbf {(E) Radial Distribution:} Radial distribution function $g(r)$ vs. distance from center $r = \sqrt {S_k^2 + S_t^2 + S_e^2}$ shows three peaks: $r \approx 0.72$ ($g(r) \approx 35$, primary peak), $r \approx 0.80$ ($g(r) \approx 10$, secondary peak), $r \approx 0.84$ ($g(r) \approx 8$, tertiary peak). The multi-peak structure indicates shell-like organization, analogous to electron shells in atoms. Molecules preferentially occupy discrete radial distances, suggesting quantization of categorical states. \textbf {(F) Phase Trajectories:} Scatter plot in $(S_k, S_e)$ plane shows multiple trajectories (colored dots: purple, blue, cyan, yellow, orange, red). Trajectories are vertically aligned ($S_k \approx $ constant), indicating evolution proceeds primarily in $S_e$ dimension at fixed knowledge level. The vertical alignment confirms that knowledge entropy $S_k$ is approximately conserved during trajectory evolution, while evolution entropy $S_e$ fluctuates freely}{figure.20}{}}
