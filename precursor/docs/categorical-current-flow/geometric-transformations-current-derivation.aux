Surface scattering has $s \sim 0.1$ with complex temperature dependence and $\lambda \sim $ film thickness. (\textbf {C}) Mean free path from aperture density: Mean free path $\lambda = 1/(n\sigma )$ versus scatterer density $n$ (m$^{-3}$) on a log-log plot. The blue line shows $\lambda \propto 1/n$. Horizontal dashed lines mark typical values for copper ($\lambda \sim 40$ nm, green) and iron ($\lambda \sim 5$ nm, orange). At low density ($n \sim 10^{18}$ m$^{-3}$), mean free paths are macroscopic ($\lambda \sim 10^{10}$ nm). At high density ($n \sim 10^{24}$ m$^{-3}$), mean free paths are atomic ($\lambda \sim 10^4$ nm). (\textbf {D}) Resistance as aperture barrier sum: Resistance $R = \sum _a \Phi _a/e = (1/e) \sum _a 1/(s_a \tau _s)$. Each scatterer (red X) acts as an aperture barrier. The total resistance is the sum of individual aperture potentials along the conductor (blue bar). This formula unifies microscopic scattering with macroscopic resistance}{figure.6}{}}

The normal region ($x > 3$ mm, blue) has finite entropy production. The sharp boundary demonstrates the phase transition at $T_c$. Total $\Sigma \sigma ' = 15.93$ (only from normal region).
