(B) Selectivity ordering: covalent bonds (very low $s \approx 0.01$, high barrier), ionic bonds (low $s \approx 0.05$), hydrogen bonds (medium $s \approx 0.1$), Van der Waals (high $s \approx 0.5$, low barrier). This hierarchy determines transport rates and phase behaviour. (C) Transport rate as selectivity product: when a molecule traverses multiple apertures, the rate $\propto \prod _{a \in \text {path}} s_a$ decreases exponentially with path length. This explains why viscosity increases with molecular complexity. (D) Phase transitions as aperture reconfiguration: solid $\to $ liquid destroys lattice apertures; liquid $\to $ gas destroys intermolecular apertures. Latent heat = sum of destroyed aperture potentials. Melting is ``unlocking'' the phase-lock network}{figure.11}{}}

(A) S-coordinate evolution: three analytes (polar/fast, medium, nonpolar/slow) show characteristic evolution patterns as they traverse the 15~cm column. Each point represents a measurable cross-section---the S-sliding window in action. Polar analytes evolve rapidly toward the stationary phase; nonpolar analytes, already close in S-space, evolve slowly. (B) Prediction vs measurement: scatter plot comparing predicted $S_k$ (from $\mathcal  {T}_{dx}[\vec  {S}(x)]$) to measured $S_k$ at each cross-section. All three analytes achieve $R^2 = 1.000$, validating the transformation. Points lie exactly on the identity line, confirming that $\vec  {S}(x+dx) = \mathcal  {T}_{dx}[\vec  {S}(x)]$ at every position. (C) Aperture selectivity profile: selectivity $s = \exp (-d_S/\sigma _S)$ varies along the column as analytes approach or recede from the stationary phase S-coordinates. Polar analytes have low selectivity (weak retention, fast passage); nonpolar analytes have high selectivity (strong retention, slow passage). This validates the aperture interpretation of chromatographic retention. (D) Memory accumulation: the accumulated memory $\mathcal  {M}(x) = \DOTSI \intop \ilimits@ \tau _p \cdot g \cdot |d\vec  {S}|$ increases along the column, with the rate depending on analyte properties. Memory accumulation rate equals local viscosity, validating the ``viscosity as time emergence'' framework. The medium analyte accumulates most memory (large S-displacement with moderate coupling); the nonpolar analyte accumulates least (minimal S-displacement, already phase-locked). (E) Prediction error: the error $\|\vec  {S}_{\text  {meas}} - \vec  {S}_{\text  {pred}}\|$ remains near zero at all cross-sections for all analytes, confirming transformation validity across the entire column. (F) Measurement schematic: multiple detection points along the column enable cross-sectional observation. Each vertical line represents a UV/MS measurement window; together they validate $\mathcal  {T}_{dx}$ at every step. This transforms chromatography from single-point detection to distributed S-space observation.}}{80}{figure.17}\protected@file@percent }
