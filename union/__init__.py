# Union of Two Crowns - Unified Mass Spectrometry Framework
"""
This package implements the theoretical framework from "Union of Two Crowns"
which establishes the equivalence between:
- Classical mechanics (phase space trajectories)
- Quantum mechanics (state superpositions)
- Partition coordinates (n, l, m, s)

The key insight is that mass spectrometry can be understood as
measurement in partition coordinate space, where:
- Chromatography = electric trap array computation
- Ionization = partition coordinate assignment
- Detection = categorical measurement with minimal back-action
