Concentric circles show $n = 1$ (innermost, dark blue), $n = 2$ (cyan), $n = 3$ (green), $n = 4$ (light green). Each shell corresponds to a distinct energy level with $E_n \propto -1/n^2$. The radial extent scales as $\langle r \rangle \propto n^2$, so outer shells are progressively more diffuse. The number of radial nodes in the wave function equals $n - l - 1$, reflecting the nested structure. This coordinate measures the "depth" of the partition in the energy hierarchy. \textbf  {(B)} Angular complexity coordinate $l$ (azimuthal quantum number) represents the boundary shape. Four shapes shown: $l = 0$ (s-orbital, blue circle, spherically symmetric, no angular nodes), $l = 1$ (p-orbital, magenta dumbbell, one nodal plane), $l = 2$ (d-orbital, red cloverleaf, two nodal planes), $l = 3$ (f-orbital, orange complex shape, three nodal planes). The number of angular nodes equals $l$, and the angular momentum magnitude is $L = \sqrt  {l(l+1)}\hbar $. Higher $l$ corresponds to more complex phase space topology and higher rotational kinetic energy. This coordinate measures the "shape complexity" of the partition boundary. \textbf  {(C)} Orientation coordinate $m$ (magnetic quantum number) represents the spatial direction of the angular momentum vector. Shown for $l = 2$ (d-orbital): five possible orientations $m \in \{-2, -1, 0, +1, +2\}$, depicted as vectors pointing in different directions from a central nucleus (blue dot). Each orientation corresponds to a different projection of angular momentum along the quantization axis (typically chosen as $z$-axis): $L_z = m\hbar $. In the absence of external fields, all $m$ states have the same energy (degeneracy). An external magnetic field breaks this degeneracy (Zeeman effect), with energy shifts $\Delta E = m \mu _B B$. This coordinate measures the "orientation" of the partition in space. \textbf  {(D)} Chirality coordinate $s$ (spin quantum number) represents boundary handedness. Two possible values: $s = +1/2$ (spin-up, red arrow pointing up) and $s = -1/2$ (spin-down, blue arrow pointing down). This is an intrinsic topological property of the partition boundary, not related to spatial rotation. The spin angular momentum magnitude is $S = \sqrt  {s(s+1)}\hbar = \sqrt  {3}/2 \hbar $, with $z$-component $S_z = s\hbar = \pm \hbar /2$. Spin-up and spin-down states have opposite magnetic moments: $\mu _s = \pm g_s \mu _B/2$, where $g_s \approx 2$ is the spin g-factor. This coordinate measures the "handedness" or "chirality" of the partition. \textbf  {(E)} Geometric constraints on partition coordinates. The complete coordinate specification is the 4-tuple $(n, l, m, s)$ with constraints: $n \geq 1$ (positive integer, partition depth), $l \in \{0, 1, \ldots  , n-1\}$ (angular complexity bounded by depth), $m \in \{-l, -l+1, \ldots  , +l-1, +l\}$ (orientation bounded by complexity, $2l+1$ values), $s \in \{-1/2, +1/2\}$ (chirality has two values). These constraints arise from the geometry of bounded phase space and ensure that partition coordinates form a consistent labeling system. \textbf  {(F)} Shell capacity formula $C(n) = 2n^2$ showing the maximum number of electrons that can occupy shell $n$. Bar chart shows: $n=1$ (blue, $C=2$), $n=2$ (cyan, $C=8$), $n=3$ (green, $C=18$), $n=4$ (teal, $C=32$), $n=5$ (light green, $C=50$). The factor of 2 comes from spin degeneracy ($s = \pm 1/2$), and the $n^2$ comes from the number of $(l,m)$ pairs: $\DOTSB \sum@ \slimits@ _{l=0}^{n-1}(2l+1) = n^2$. This formula explains the periodic table structure: periods have lengths 2, 8, 8, 18, 18, 32, 32, \ldots  , corresponding to filling shells in order of energy. The capacity formula is a direct consequence of partition coordinate constraints and the exclusion principle (no two electrons can have identical coordinates). Together, these six panels define the complete partition coordinate system $(n, l, m, s)$ that labels all possible electron states in atoms and molecules.

(B) Temperature dependence: $\langle \tau _p\rangle \propto \sqrt {m/(k_B T)}$ for gases (kinetic theory); $\langle \tau _p\rangle \propto \exp (E_a/k_B T)$ for liquids (Arrhenius activation). This explains the opposite temperature dependence of viscosity in gases (increases) vs liquids (decreases). (C) Collision vs uncertainty limits: $\tau _p = \max (\tau _{\text {coll}}, \hbar /\Delta E)$. In gases, collisions limit completion; in quantum systems, uncertainty limits completion. (D) Pressure dependence: $\tau _p \propto P^{-1/2}$ at fixed temperature---higher pressure increases collision frequency, reducing partition lag. This explains pressure-viscosity coupling in gases}{figure.4}{}}

Oscillators are color-coded by coordinate: $n$ (electronic, red), $\ell $ (vibrational, blue), $m$ (rotational, green), $s$ (hyperfine, yellow). Phase relationships between oscillators encode categorical state information through the relative phase $\Delta \phi _{ij} = (\omega _i - \omega _j)t + \phi _0$.

At optimal ensemble size, temporal resolution reaches $\Delta t = 10^{-16}$ s with near-unity spatial coverage $C \approx 0.95$.

Phase relationships between oscillators encode categorical state information through the relative phase $\Delta \phi _{ij} = (\omega _i - \omega _j)t + \phi _0$. The ensemble spans the full frequency range required for complete $(n, \ell , m, s)$ coordinate specification. \textbf {(B)} Temporal resolution versus ensemble size shows inverse square root scaling ($\Delta t \propto N^{-1/2}$, blue line) until optimal ensemble size $N_{\text {opt}} = 10^5$ is reached (black point), beyond which spatial coverage $C$ (red line) decreases due to overcrowding in phase space. At optimal ensemble size, temporal resolution reaches $\Delta t = 10^{-16}$ s with near-unity spatial coverage $C \approx 0.95$. The trade-off between resolution and coverage determines the optimal ensemble configuration. \textbf {(C)} Phase accumulation for two oscillators with frequencies $\omega _1$ (blue) and $\omega _2$ (red) shows linear phase growth $\phi _i(t) = \omega _i t + \phi _{i,0}$ over time. Phase difference $\Delta \phi = (\omega _2 - \omega _1)t$ (black line) accumulates more slowly, providing a beat frequency measurement $\omega _{\text {beat}} = \omega _2 - \omega _1$ that encodes the categorical state transition rate. The beat frequency is immune to common-mode phase noise, providing robust categorical state discrimination. \textbf {(D)} Categorical temporal resolution improves dramatically with ensemble size. Single oscillator ($N = 1$, blue) provides poor frequency discrimination with broad detection peak. Moderate ensemble ($N = 10$, teal) shows improved peak sharpness with FWHM $\propto N^{-1/2}$. Large ensemble ($N = 100$, green) approaches ideal resolution. Optimal ensemble ($N = 1000$, red) achieves near-perfect frequency discrimination at $\omega /\omega _0 = 1.000$, enabling categorical state identification with $\delta t = 10^{-138}$ s resolution through state counting across the full $N \sim 10^{129}$ measurement ensemble}{figure.23}{}}

Level 1 (Temporal, blue): three temporal bins $t \in \{0,1,2\}$ divide the transition into initial, intermediate, and final phases. Level 2 (Spatial, orange): three spatial partitions $p \in \{0,1,2\}$ encode radial, angular, and mixed coordinates. Level 3 (Molecular, colored): four molecular degrees of freedom map to partition coordinates: electronic ($n$, green), vibrational ($\ell $, pink), rotational ($m$, purple), spin ($s$, brown). Each coordinate takes trit values $\{0,1,2\}$. Example for H $1s \to 2p$ transition: Initial state $[0][0][1][2] = 0012_3$ (base-3 encoding). Final state $[1][1][1][2] = 1112_3$. The ternary encoding provides $3^4 = 81$ distinct categorical states, sufficient to uniquely identify all relevant quantum states in the hydrogen $n \leq 3$ manifold. \textbf  {Top Right:} Electron trajectory in S-entropy space $(S_k, S_t, S_e)$ for $1s \to 2p$ transition shows deterministic path (blue curve) from initial state (green sphere, $1s$) through intermediate states (blue triangles) to final state (red square, $2p$). Knowledge entropy $S_k$ increases from 0.25 to 0.45 as information about the electron's state accumulates. Temporal entropy $S_t$ increases from 0.30 to 0.40 as the transition progresses. Evolution entropy $S_e$ increases from 0.08 to 0.24 as the trajectory explores phase space. The trajectory is smooth and continuous, with no discontinuous jumps, confirming deterministic evolution through partition space. Total S-entropy increases $\Delta S_{\text  {total}} = \sqrt  {\Delta S_k^2 + \Delta S_t^2 + \Delta S_e^2} = 0.28$, consistent with the second law of categorical thermodynamics. \textbf  {Middle Left:} Trit sequence evolution during $1s \to 2p$ transition shows temporal evolution of all four partition coordinates. Horizontal axis: time from 0 ns (initial) to 10 ns (final). Vertical axis: molecular degree of freedom. Color indicates trit value: purple (0), pink (1), cyan (2), yellow (2 with emphasis). Electronic coordinate ($n$, top row): transitions from 0 (purple) to 2 (cyan) at $t \approx 2.5$ ns, with brief intermediate state. Vibrational coordinate ($\ell $, second row): shows complex evolution with multiple transitions between 0, 1, and 2 (red box highlights region of rapid switching at $t = 2.5$--$7.5$ ns). Rotational coordinate ($m$, third row): transitions from 0 to 2 with intermediate states. Spin coordinate ($s$, bottom row): remains constant at 2 (yellow) throughout, confirming $\Delta s = 0$ selection rule. The trit sequence provides a complete categorical description of the electron trajectory with temporal resolution $\delta t = 10^{-138}$ s (achieved through state counting, not shown at this coarse-grained timescale). \textbf  {Middle Right:} Measurement modality to trit mapping shows how each experimental technique maps to partition coordinates. Optical spectroscopy $\to $ Electronic state $\to $ $n \in \{0,1,2\}$: measures electronic transitions via absorption/emission spectra. Raman spectroscopy $\to $ Vibrational mode $\to $ $\ell \in \{0,1,2\}$: measures vibrational transitions via inelastic scattering. Microwave spectroscopy $\to $ Rotational state $\to $ $m \in \{0,1,2\}$: measures rotational transitions via pure rotational spectra. Magnetic resonance $\to $ Spin projection $\to $ $s \in \{0,1,2\}$: measures spin states via Zeeman splitting (note: $s$ actually takes values $\{-1/2, +1/2\}$ but is mapped to trits for encoding). S-entropy coupling (bottom): shows how different S-entropy components couple to different coordinates: $S_t \leftrightarrow $ Electronic (blue), $S_k \leftrightarrow $ Vibrational (orange), $S_e \leftrightarrow $ Rotational (green). This coupling structure enables cross-coordinate information catalysis observed in Figure 5E.}}{126}{figure.33}\protected@file@percent }

Level 2 (Spatial, orange): three spatial partitions $p \in \{0,1,2\}$ encode radial, angular, and mixed coordinates. Level 3 (Molecular, colored): four molecular degrees of freedom map to partition coordinates: electronic ($n$, green), vibrational ($\ell $, pink), rotational ($m$, purple), spin ($s$, brown). Each coordinate takes trit values $\{0,1,2\}$. Example for H $1s \to 2p$ transition: Initial state $[0][0][1][2] = 0012_3$ (base-3 encoding). Final state $[1][1][1][2] = 1112_3$. The ternary encoding provides $3^4 = 81$ distinct categorical states, sufficient to uniquely identify all relevant quantum states in the hydrogen $n \leq 3$ manifold. \textbf {Top Right:} Electron trajectory in S-entropy space $(S_k, S_t, S_e)$ for $1s \to 2p$ transition shows deterministic path (blue curve) from initial state (green sphere, $1s$) through intermediate states (blue triangles) to final state (red square, $2p$). Knowledge entropy $S_k$ increases from 0.25 to 0.45 as information about the electron's state accumulates. Temporal entropy $S_t$ increases from 0.30 to 0.40 as the transition progresses. Evolution entropy $S_e$ increases from 0.08 to 0.24 as the trajectory explores phase space. The trajectory is smooth and continuous, with no discontinuous jumps, confirming deterministic evolution through partition space. Total S-entropy increases $\Delta S_{\text {total}} = \sqrt {\Delta S_k^2 + \Delta S_t^2 + \Delta S_e^2} = 0.28$, consistent with the second law of categorical thermodynamics. \textbf {Middle Left:} Trit sequence evolution during $1s \to 2p$ transition shows temporal evolution of all four partition coordinates. Horizontal axis: time from 0 ns (initial) to 10 ns (final). Vertical axis: molecular degree of freedom. Color indicates trit value: purple (0), pink (1), cyan (2), yellow (2 with emphasis). Electronic coordinate ($n$, top row): transitions from 0 (purple) to 2 (cyan) at $t \approx 2.5$ ns, with brief intermediate state. Vibrational coordinate ($\ell $, second row): shows complex evolution with multiple transitions between 0, 1, and 2 (red box highlights region of rapid switching at $t = 2.5$--$7.5$ ns). Rotational coordinate ($m$, third row): transitions from 0 to 2 with intermediate states. Spin coordinate ($s$, bottom row): remains constant at 2 (yellow) throughout, confirming $\Delta s = 0$ selection rule. The trit sequence provides a complete categorical description of the electron trajectory with temporal resolution $\delta t = 10^{-138}$ s (achieved through state counting, not shown at this coarse-grained timescale). \textbf {Middle Right:} Measurement modality to trit mapping shows how each experimental technique maps to partition coordinates. Optical spectroscopy $\to $ Electronic state $\to $ $n \in \{0,1,2\}$: measures electronic transitions via absorption/emission spectra. Raman spectroscopy $\to $ Vibrational mode $\to $ $\ell \in \{0,1,2\}$: measures vibrational transitions via inelastic scattering. Microwave spectroscopy $\to $ Rotational state $\to $ $m \in \{0,1,2\}$: measures rotational transitions via pure rotational spectra. Magnetic resonance $\to $ Spin projection $\to $ $s \in \{0,1,2\}$: measures spin states via Zeeman splitting (note: $s$ actually takes values $\{-1/2, +1/2\}$ but is mapped to trits for encoding). S-entropy coupling (bottom): shows how different S-entropy components couple to different coordinates: $S_t \leftrightarrow $ Electronic (blue), $S_k \leftrightarrow $ Vibrational (orange), $S_e \leftrightarrow $ Rotational (green). This coupling structure enables cross-coordinate information catalysis observed in Figure 5E}{figure.33}{}}

All 8 directions passing would yield $C_8 = 92.3\%$ (orange bar). The 90\% confidence target (red dashed line) is exceeded at 7 passing directions. Confidence follows $C(n) = 1 - (1-p)^n$ where $p = 0.95$ is the per-direction confidence. Seven independent validations provide strong evidence ($> 90\%$ confidence) for genuine electron trajectory observation. \textbf  {Bottom Left:} Experimental deviation from theoretical predictions shows all 8 directions remain within 5\% threshold (red dashed line).

Even extremely skeptical observers (1\% prior) reach 48.5\% posterior, a $48\times $ increase in belief. This demonstrates the robustness of the experimental evidence: the data compel belief in electron trajectory observation regardless of initial skepticism, following Bayes' theorem $P(H|E) = P(E|H)P(H)/P(E)$ with likelihood ratio $\text  {LR} = P(E|H)/P(E|\neg H) \approx 100$.}}{142}{figure.40}\protected@file@percent }
