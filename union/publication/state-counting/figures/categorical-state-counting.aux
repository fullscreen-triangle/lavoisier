Per-shell count follows $C(n) = 2n^2$ (quadratic), increasing from 2 ($n=1$) to 450 ($n=15$). The quadratic per-shell and cubic cumulative scaling reflect the fundamental capacity law of partition space. (C) Angular coverage by shell: polar plot showing sensor distribution in $(\theta , \phi )$ space for five shells ($n=2,4,6,8,10$, colored blue to purple). Each shell forms a closed contour with radial extent proportional to sensor density. Lower shells ($n=2$, blue) have sparse coverage concentrated near poles ($\theta = 0°, 180°$), while higher shells ($n=10$, purple) provide dense uniform coverage across all angles.

The distribution is given by $f(v) = \sqrt  {(m/2\pi k_B T)^3} \, 4\pi v^2 \exp (-mv^2/2k_B T)$, which formally allows arbitrarily large velocities ($v \to \infty $). However, this violates special relativity: particles cannot exceed the speed of light $c = 299{,}792$ km/s. (B) Maxwell-Boltzmann with relativistic cutoff $v_{\max } = c$: probability density $f(v)$ vs. velocity $v$ (km/s) comparing three cases—without cutoff (blue dashed line, extends beyond $c$), with cutoff at $c$ (red solid line, truncated at $v = c$), and speed of light $c = 299.79$ km/s (black vertical dashed line). The red curve is identically zero for $v < c$ and shows sharp cutoff at $v = c$. This modified distribution $f_{\text  {rel}}(v) = f(v) \cdot \Theta (c - v)$, where $\Theta $ is the Heaviside step function, ensures that no particles exceed light speed.

Black line shows phase difference $\Delta \phi = (\omega _2 - \omega _1)t$ growing linearly to $\sim $1 rad at $t=10$.

This demonstrates that phase coherence time $\tau _c \sim 2\pi /\Delta \omega $ sets measurement duration: oscillators remain phase-locked for $t < \tau _c$, enabling coherent averaging. \textbf  {Panel D (Categorical Temporal Resolution)}: Detection sensitivity versus normalized frequency $\omega /\omega _0$ shows four curves for ensemble sizes $N = 1, 10, 100, 1000$ (blue, cyan, green, red).
