    \caption{\textbf{Time-of-Flight (TOF) Mass Spectrometer: Ion trajectory dynamics and detection principles.}
    (\textbf{A}) 3D Ion Trajectories demonstrating mass-dependent flight paths through the TOF analyzer. Lighter ions (m/z = 100, blue) arrive at the detector before heavier ions (m/z = 500, green; m/z = 1000, orange; m/z = 2000, red), with flight times proportional to $\sqrt{m/z}$. Trajectories show minimal spatial dispersion ($\pm$0.04 mm) in the radial dimension, confirming effective ion beam collimation. The vertical axis spans 0--1000 arbitrary units representing detector position.
    (\textbf{B}) Velocity-Time Relationship showing the fundamental TOF equation $v = \sqrt{2eV/m}$ across the m/z range 150--2000 and flight times 2.5--20 $\mu$s. The 3D surface illustrates how ion velocity (300--1000 m/s) depends inversely on mass, with the color gradient (purple to yellow) indicating velocity magnitude. This relationship enables mass determination from measured arrival times with sub-ppm precision at high resolution.
    (\textbf{C}) Energy Distribution Phase Space demonstrating reflectron focusing for energy compensation. The 3D surface shows angular spread (0--12$^\circ$) as a function of initial position (0--100 mm) and kinetic energy (0--100 eV). Reflectron geometry creates a focal plane where ions of identical m/z but different initial energies arrive simultaneously, improving mass resolution from $\sim$5,000 to $>$40,000 FWHM.
    (\textbf{D}) Detection Efficiency Landscape mapping microchannel plate (MCP) response across impact angle (0--100$^\circ$) and m/z (0--8000). Detection efficiency (0--0.8) peaks at normal incidence and decreases with increasing mass due to reduced secondary electron yield. The 3D surface guides optimal detector positioning and predicts sensitivity variations across the mass range.}

    \caption{\textbf{Quadrupole Mass Filter: RF trajectory dynamics and mass-selective transmission.}
    (\textbf{A}) 3D RF Trajectory Dynamics comparing stable (transmitted, green helix) and unstable (rejected, red expanding spiral) ion trajectories. Stable ions execute bounded oscillations within the quadrupole field ($\pm$4 mm radial extent) over multiple RF cycles (0--50), while unstable ions exhibit exponentially growing amplitudes leading to electrode collision. The helical trajectory pattern reflects the superposition of secular motion at frequency $\omega_0$ and RF micromotion at $\Omega$.
    (\textbf{B}) Mathieu Stability Diagram showing the first stability region in $(a, q)$ parameter space, where $a = 8eU/m\Omega^2 r_0^2$ and $q = 4eV/m\Omega^2 r_0^2$. The 3D surface displays transmission probability (0--1.0) across the stability zone bounded by $\beta_x = 0, 1$ and $\beta_y = 0, 1$ iso-lines. Only ions within the stable region (green/yellow) reach the detector; operating at the apex provides unit mass resolution while the base enables high transmission.
    (\textbf{C}) Potential Energy Landscape illustrating the saddle-point potential $\Phi(x,y) = \frac{\Phi_0}{r_0^2}(x^2 - y^2)$ characteristic of quadrupole fields. The 3D surface spans $\pm$4 mm in both transverse dimensions with potential ranging from $-$750 to $+$750 V. The hyperbolic saddle shape creates focusing in one plane and defocusing in the orthogonal plane, with RF alternation producing net confinement for stable masses.
    (\textbf{D}) Mass Scan Performance showing the speed-sensitivity trade-off across scan rates (100--1000 amu/s) and target m/z (0--2000). The 3D surface displays peak intensity (0--900 counts) degradation at high scan speeds due to insufficient ion transit time for stable trajectory establishment. Optimal operation balances throughput against resolution requirements, with the color gradient indicating sensitivity from purple (low) to yellow (high).}

    \caption{\textbf{Ion Trap (Paul Trap): 3D confinement dynamics and mass-selective ejection mechanisms.}
    (\textbf{A}) 3D Trapping Trajectories showing complex Lissajous patterns within the trap volume. Ion motion exhibits quasi-periodic oscillations in radial ($\pm$2 mm) and axial ($\pm$3 mm) dimensions over multiple RF cycles. Color-coded trajectories (purple to yellow gradient) demonstrate secular motion with frequencies $\omega_r$ and $\omega_z$ creating intricate 3D orbital patterns. Bounded trajectories confirm stable trapping with ions confined within the yellow boundary surface representing the trap's effective potential well.
    (\textbf{B}) Effective Potential Wells demonstrating harmonic confinement with pseudopotential $U_{\text{eff}}(r,z) = \frac{1}{2}m(\omega_r^{2} r^{2} + \omega_z^{2} z^{2})$. The 3D surface shows radial (0--5 mm) and axial ($\pm$4 mm) potential distribution with energy scale 0--70,000 eV. Deep potential wells (purple regions) provide strong ion confinement, while the harmonic shape enables mass-dependent secular frequencies. Color gradient from purple (deep well) to yellow (high potential) illustrates the three-dimensional trapping geometry.
    (\textbf{C}) Mass Ejection Dynamics showing resonance ejection mechanism across m/z range 0--1000. The 3D surface demonstrates ejection time (0--10 ms) dependence on applied ejection voltage (0--10 V) and target mass. Parametric resonance excitation selectively destabilizes specific m/z values, with ejection time decreasing at higher voltages. Color progression from purple (long ejection times) to yellow (rapid ejection) shows mass-selective scanning capability through controlled resonance activation.
    (\textbf{D}) Ion Cloud Evolution demonstrating collisional cooling effects over time (0--10 ms). Three temporal snapshots show ion density distribution across the trap cross-section ($\pm$4 mm $\times$ $\pm$4 mm). Initial broad distribution (top layer) progressively contracts through buffer gas collisions, reaching thermal equilibrium (bottom layer). Color scale from purple (low density) to yellow (high density) illustrates spatial compression and temperature reduction, improving mass resolution by reducing ion kinetic energy spread.}

\begin{figure}[htbp]

    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{04_fticr_mass_spectrometer.png}
    \caption{\textbf{FT-ICR (Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance) Mass Spectrometer: Cyclotron motion and frequency-based mass measurement.}
    (\textbf{A}) 3D Ion Cyclotron Orbits demonstrating mass-dependent orbital frequencies in a 7 Tesla magnetic field. Ions execute circular orbits in the $xy$-plane perpendicular to the magnetic field vector $\mathbf{B}$ (indicated by arrow), with cyclotron frequency $\omega_c = qB/m$ inversely proportional to mass. Lighter ions (m/z = 100, red) complete more orbits per unit time than heavier ions (m/z = 500, blue; m/z = 1000, green; m/z = 2000, purple). The slight axial drift along $z$ reflects magnetron motion and ion injection dynamics. Orbital radius remains constant ($\sim$30 mm) for ions of equal kinetic energy.
    (\textbf{B}) Cyclotron Frequency Relationship showing the fundamental FT-ICR equation $\omega_c = qB/m$ as a 3D surface across m/z range 0--2000 and magnetic field strength 4--14 Tesla. Cyclotron frequency (0.25--1.75 MHz) decreases with increasing mass and increases with magnetic field strength. The surface gradient illustrates why higher magnetic fields provide better mass resolution: frequency separation $\Delta\omega_c$ between adjacent masses scales linearly with $B$. Color gradient from purple (low frequency) to yellow (high frequency) enables rapid visual assessment of operating conditions.
    (\textbf{C}) Image Current Detection illustrating the Fourier Transform process that converts time-domain ion signals to mass spectra. The 3D visualization shows: time-domain transient signal (blue oscillating trace in $xz$-plane) representing image current induced by orbiting ion packets, and frequency-domain peaks (red bars in $yz$-plane) obtained via FFT. Multiple m/z components (500, 750, 1000) produce distinct frequency peaks that are resolved and converted to mass values. Signal decay reflects ion dephasing and collision-induced damping over the 0--1000 ms acquisition window.
    (\textbf{D}) Mass Resolution Landscape showing the ultra-high resolution capability of FT-ICR across m/z range 0--2000 and observation time 0--2 seconds. Resolution $R = m/\Delta m$ exceeds $10^6$ at low mass with extended transient times, following $R \propto \omega_c \cdot T_{\text{obs}}$. The 3D surface (purple to yellow gradient) demonstrates that resolution degrades with increasing mass (lower $\omega_c$) but improves with longer observation times. This trade-off between throughput and resolution guides experimental design for ultrahigh-resolution applications including isotope fine structure and isobaric separation.}

    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{05_orbitrap_mass_spectrometer.png}
    \caption{\textbf{Orbitrap Mass Spectrometer: Electrostatic trapping and axial oscillation frequency detection.}
    (\textbf{A}) 3D Ion Trajectories in Orbitrap showing the characteristic spiral motion around the central spindle electrode (gray surface). Ions are injected tangentially and orbit the central electrode while oscillating axially with frequency $\omega = \sqrt{k/m}$, where $k$ is the field curvature constant. Different m/z values (200 red, 500 blue, 1000 green, 1500 purple) exhibit mass-dependent axial frequencies: lighter ions oscillate faster, completing more $z$-axis cycles during a single orbital period. The spindle electrode geometry (hyperboloid shape) generates the quadro-logarithmic potential that provides harmonic axial restoring force while maintaining stable radial orbits ($\pm$20--50 mm radius).
    (\textbf{B}) Axial Oscillation Frequency showing the fundamental Orbitrap equation $\omega = \sqrt{k/m}$ as a 3D surface across m/z range 100--2000 and relative field strength 0.5--2.0. Axial frequency (1--5 kHz typical) decreases with $\sqrt{m}$ and increases with field strength. Unlike FT-ICR where $\omega_c \propto 1/m$, the Orbitrap's $\omega \propto 1/\sqrt{m}$ dependence provides more uniform frequency spacing across the mass range. Color gradient (purple to yellow) indicates frequency magnitude, with highest frequencies at low mass and high field strength.
    (\textbf{C}) Orbitrap Electrostatic Potential displaying the quadro-logarithmic field $U(r,z) = \frac{k}{2}\left(z^2 - \frac{r^2}{2}\right) + \frac{k}{2}R_m^2\ln(r/R_m)$ characteristic of the Orbitrap geometry. The 3D surface shows potential (normalized 0--1) as a function of radial position $r$ (10--50 mm) and axial position $z$ ($\pm$40 mm). The saddle-point topology provides axial confinement (harmonic well along $z$) while permitting stable radial orbits (logarithmic potential in $r$). Contour lines on the $z = 0$ plane illustrate equipotential surfaces. The central electrode radius $R_m \approx$ 8 mm defines the inner boundary.
    (\textbf{D}) Orbitrap Resolution showing mass resolving power $R = m/\Delta m$ as a function of m/z (200--2000) and transient acquisition time (32--512 ms). Resolution scales as $R \propto \omega \cdot T_{\text{transient}} \propto T/\sqrt{m}$, reaching 240,000 at m/z 400 with 256 ms transient (marked with red star as typical operating point). The 3D surface (purple to yellow gradient) demonstrates the resolution-speed trade-off: shorter transients enable faster scan rates at reduced resolution, while extended transients achieve ultrahigh resolution for applications requiring isotopic fine structure or isobaric discrimination. Maximum resolution exceeds 500,000 at low mass with 512 ms transients.}

The 3D visualization displays the target state (red star) at coordinates $(S_k, S_t, S_e) = (0.7, 0.5, 0.8)$ within the unit cube $[0,1]^3$. The blue shaded region represents the reachable state space constrained by physical realizability bounds. Users specify desired molecular properties through S-Entropy coordinates rather than explicit molecular structure, enabling inverse design from observables.
    (\textbf{B}) Determine Conditions showing the input filter that computes required experimental conditions from target S-Entropy coordinates. For target $(0.7, 0.5, 0.8)$, the system determines: Temperature = 298 K, Pressure = 1 atm, Field = 50 mV/m, Frequency = 2.4 GHz, Gradient = 15\%/cm. Physical constraints are automatically enforced: thermodynamically stable (green check), within realizability bounds (green check), no forbidden transitions (green check).
    (\textbf{C}) Generate Protocol showing the output filter that produces an executable synthesis protocol. The step-by-step procedure includes: (1) Initialize system and equilibrate to 298 K, (2) Drive vibrational modes at specified frequencies (2.35 GHz for 10 ms, 2.47 GHz for 15 ms, 2.68 GHz for 8 ms), (3) Apply field gradient 15\%/cm for 20 minutes while monitoring S-coordinates, (4) Verify convergence within 5\% of target. Duration estimates and success probabilities are provided.
    (\textbf{D}) Synthesis Trajectory showing convergence from initial to target state. The plot tracks S-Entropy coordinates ($S_k$ blue, $S_t$ red, $S_e$ green) as functions of synthesis progress (0--1). All three coordinates monotonically approach their target values (dashed lines at 0.7, 0.5, 0.8), demonstrating successful state synthesis through the categorical framework.

The quality threshold at 0.3 (red dashed line) separates valid (above) from invalid droplets. Uniform quality distribution across intensity range confirms intensity-independent physical realizability.
    (\textbf{Bottom Right}) Validation Statistics table summarizing: Weber Number mean $396.80 \pm 77.63$, 0.0\% valid; Reynolds Number mean $12,524.94 \pm 1,519.5$; Ohnesorge Number mean $0.002 \pm 0.000$; Physics Quality mean $0.404 \pm 0.002$, 100.0\% valid. The high physics validity rate confirms successful bijective encoding.}

    \caption{\textbf{Droplet Image Analysis for Spectrum 100.}
    (\textbf{Top}) Thermodynamic Droplet Wave Image (512$\times$512) showing the full composite wave pattern generated from Spectrum 100. The grayscale visualization (0--255 pixel intensity) displays complex interference patterns from 862 individual ion droplets. Concentric ring structures emanate from multiple impact centers, with wave amplitude decaying radially. The pattern serves as a unique visual fingerprint encoding complete spectral information in a format amenable to computer vision analysis.
    (\textbf{Middle Left}) Pixel Intensity Distribution histogram showing the frequency of pixel values across the 512$\times$512 image. The asymmetric distribution peaked around intensity 150--180 with long left tail indicates predominance of mid-gray tones with sparse dark regions. This distribution shape is characteristic of interference patterns with constructive superposition.
    (\textbf{Middle Center}) Horizontal Center Profile plotting intensity along row 256 (image center). The oscillatory pattern with $\sim$50 pixel wavelength demonstrates regular wave structure. Amplitude modulation (envelope) reflects interference between droplet sources at varying distances from the profile line.
    (\textbf{Middle Right}) Vertical Center Profile along column 256 showing similar oscillatory character with slightly different amplitude envelope, reflecting the 2D structure of the wave interference pattern.
    (\textbf{Bottom Left}) Edge Detection (Sobel) showing gradient magnitude highlighting wave fronts and interference boundaries. The colormap (blue-yellow-red) emphasizes high-gradient regions corresponding to wave crests and troughs. This representation enhances feature extraction for computer vision matching algorithms.
    (\textbf{Bottom Center}) Gradient Distribution histogram (log scale) showing the frequency of Sobel gradient magnitudes. The exponential decay from low to high gradients indicates smooth wave patterns with occasional sharp transitions.
    (\textbf{Bottom Right}) Image Quality Metrics including: Basic Statistics (mean 145.35, std 11.84, range 0--255); Information Theory (entropy 3.588 bits, dynamic range 255); Image Quality (contrast ratio 0.081, SNR 12.28); Coverage (262,143 non-zero pixels, 100\% coverage). These metrics enable quantitative droplet image comparison and quality assessment.}
