# Lavoisier

Lavoisier is a high performance computing solution for high data volume mass spectrometry based metabolomics data analysis 
pipelines. Lavoisier contains two main pipelines : 
1. A numerical analysis pipeline that uses established computational methods for ion spectra extraction, annotates ion peaks through a combination of database search, application of fragmentation rules and natural language processing methods.
2. An in-house visual method that converts spectra into a video format and applies computer vision methods for annotation.
