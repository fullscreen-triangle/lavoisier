## Experimental Protocol

### Phase 1: Traditional Analysis
```python
for sample in sample_list:
    start_time = time.time()
    
    # Run standard Lavoisier pipeline
    numerical_results = run_numerical_pipeline(sample)
    visual_results = run_visual_pipeline(sample)
    ai_results = run_ai_annotation(numerical_results, visual_results)
    
    # Record metrics
    metrics = calculate_traditional_metrics(results)
    save_results(sample, metrics, "traditional")
```

### Phase 2: Buhera-Enhanced Analysis
```python
for sample in sample_list:
    for objective in objectives:
        start_time = time.time()
        
        # Create objective-specific Buhera script
        script = create_buhera_script(sample, objective)
        
        # Validate before execution
        validation = validate_buhera_script(script)
        
        # Execute with goal-directed analysis
        buhera_results = execute_buhera_script(script, sample)
        
        # Record enhanced metrics
        metrics = calculate_buhera_metrics(buhera_results, validation)
        save_results(sample, objective, metrics, "buhera")
```

### Phase 3: Comparative Analysis
- Aggregate metrics across samples and objectives
- Statistical significance testing

- Expected: 5-15 scientific errors detected per objective

### Hypothesis 2: Analysis Accuracy  
**Buhera's goal-directed approach will improve annotation accuracy**
- Measurement: True positive rate improvement
- Expected: 10-25% improvement in correct identifications

### Hypothesis 3: Computational Efficiency
**Buhera's pre-validation will prevent wasted computation**
- Measurement: Total CPU time for equivalent quality results
- Expected: 15-30% reduction in computational waste

### Hypothesis 4: Scientific Insight Quality
**Buhera will generate more actionable biological insights**  
- Measurement: Novel insights per sample
- Expected: 2-3x more scientifically valid insights

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Large file sizes**: Process subset first, then scale
- **Memory limitations**: Implement streaming for large datasets
- **Processing time**: Parallelize analysis where possible

### Scientific Risks  
- **Unknown ground truth**: Use literature validation for known compounds
